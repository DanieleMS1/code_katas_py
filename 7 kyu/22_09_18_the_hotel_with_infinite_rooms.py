# The city of Darkishland has a strange
# hotel with infinite rooms. The groups
# that come to this hotel follow the
# following rules:
#
# At the same time only members of one
# group can rent the hotel.
#
# Each group comes in the morning of
# the check-in day and leaves the hotel
# in the evening of the check-out day.
#
# Another group comes in the very next
# morning after the previous group has
# left the hotel.
#
# A very important property of the incoming
# group is that it has one more member than
# its previous group unless it is the
# starting group. You will be given the
# number of members of the starting group.
#
# A group with n members stays for n days
# in the hotel. For example, if a group of
# four members comes on 1st August in the
# morning, it will leave the hotel on 4th
# August in the evening and the next group
# of five members will come on 5th August
# in the morning and stay for five days and
# so on.
#
# Given the initial group size you will have
# to find the group size staying in the hotel
# on a specified day.
